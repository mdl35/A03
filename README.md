# To start, the easiest part to set up is Github. Due to its online nature, it is very easy to be able to make an account and have it set up. Git requires a download and install to get it into the system. The hardest to set up is Webstorm/JetBrains, because not only does it need an account, a subscription of $69 for the first year is required, unless it is a student account, which makes it free. 

# BRANCH - individual projects within a git repository.
# CLONE - copying a repository to a different location.
# COMMIT - a snapshot of the changes within a repository.
# FETCH - a command that will download contents from a remote repository.
# GIT - a locally installed tool that is used for source code management.
# GITHUB - internet hosting service for software development that uses Git.
# MERGE - combines a series of commits into one single branch.
# MERGE CONFLICT - when Git cannot solve code differences between commits.
# PUSH - used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
# PULL - used to fetch content from a remote repository and update the local repository.
